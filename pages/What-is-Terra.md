# So What Exactly *is* Terra?
Terra is an incredibly powerful free & open-source data-driven, platform-agnostic world generator. It allows you to
create a world exactly to your specifications, with no knowledge of Java required.  
   
Terra is completely config-defined. This means that Terra doesn't know what a Forest is, or an Ocean, or even what a
cave is! All must be implemented via the config system.  
   
Terra's config system is intuitive and *relatively* simple to learn, while also being the most powerful config system yet seen in a
world generator.  
   
## How do I Get Started?
To get started with Terra, take a look at our [[Getting Started]] guide! It will walk you through the basics of
configuration, and provide a simple base config to get started with.  

## What if I don't want to configure everything myself?
Simple, use config packs! This repo currently contains Overworld and Nether config packs, ready to be put on your
server with no additional configuration.
