# Welcome to the Terra Configuration wiki

Terra is an incredibly powerful free & open-source data-driven, platform-agnostic world generator. It allows you to
create a world exactly to your specifications, with no knowledge of Java required.  
   
Terra is completely config-defined. This means that Terra doesn't know what a Forest is, or an Ocean, or even what a
cave is! All must be implemented via the config system.  
   
Terra's config system is intuitive and *relatively* simple to learn, while also being the most powerful config system yet seen in a
world generator.  

## How do I Get Started?
To get started with Terra, take a look at our [Creating a Pack](./Creating-a-Pack) guide! It will walk you through the basics of
configuration, and provide a simple base config to get started with.  

## What if I don't want to configure everything myself?
Simple, use config packs! This repo currently contains Overworld and Nether config packs, ready to be put on your
server with no additional configuration.

This wiki will give in-depth explanations of all Terra configurations, as well as a quick start guide for making a generator with Terra.
